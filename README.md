# DIDDO
## A game for those with DID

This game is not for everyone.

This game is for those who have DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) and are looking for creative ways to get to know their parts/alters and build better internal relationships. 

Ultimately, the game will have several "quests" built in. These will be anything from asking one part/alter to ask another part/alter "what is your favorite food?" to more complicated quests with multiple stages requiring co-fronting. DIDDO will also have the option for creating system goals. These can be selected from a drop-down menu of prebuilt ideas or can be custom made. Goals can be set to different difficult level to change the requirements on system communication. Completing quests and goals will give in-game rewards that can be used in various ways.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you want to take part in helping with coding or testing.
