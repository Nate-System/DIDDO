## DIDDO
#A game for those with DID
This game is not for everyone.

This game is for those who have DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) and are looking for creative ways to get to know their parts/alters and build better internal relationships. 

Ultimately, the game will have several "quests" built in. These will be anything from asking one part/alter to ask another part/alter "what is your favorite food?" to more complicated quests with multiple stages requiring co-fronting.
